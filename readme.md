Sopipe
======

Sopipe is socat with middlewares. It can be used for NAT penetration, secured* and accelerated transmission, tunnelling,
proxying†, etc. with arbitrarily chained encryption, compression, authentication, and error correction.

\* Sopipe has not got security review. The encryption-related components should be used at one's own risk. <br>
† Sopipe is not designed for circumventing censorship. The authors and contributors do not take any responsibility for
abuse or misuse of this software.
